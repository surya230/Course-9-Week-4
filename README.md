Course 9 - Shiny App

This simple shiny app allows for interactive histograms based on earthquake data near Fiji.
The data is taken from the "quakes" dataset, which is included in the standard R "datasets" library.

At the console, runApp() will launch the application, in which the user can change the granularity
of the histogram bins. The graph displaying the histogram of earthquake magnitudes will then be 
automatically updated.
